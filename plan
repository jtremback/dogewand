plan

still to do:

// Check that tips work
// Withdraw in pages
// Get reddit scraping working right
// Get bookmarklet versioning working rights
fix dropdown and modal issues
// figure out which way to go with account linking


## Sign in checking plan
* Try to retreive user info from server
* If not signed in pop login modal - need to make it choose the right provider
* If user account and signed in account do not match, pop modal with list of accounts and merge link



## signed into both
* straight up auth

## signed into site, not signed into extension
* straight up auth

## extension and site users do not match
* ask if they want to link the current site account to the currently signed in dogewand user (list of accounts)
* merge users

User
  balance

Account
  uniqid
  provider
  name
  user_id

Tip
  amount
  tipper_id
  tippee_id
  state
  hash (maybe?)

User making scenarios:
  Fresh sign up

Account making scenarios:
  New tip
  Linking account


Create user:
  Create user with 0 balance
  Find or create account with provider and uniqid and name from auth. Replace name if account
  already exists.

Auth:
  insert or update and select account
  insert user and update account with user_id
  use account.user_id to select user and join all accounts

  Case 1- user is not logged in, account exists

  Case 2- user is not logged in, account does not exist

  Case 3- user is not logged in, account exists, is not associated with user




Merge Users:
  Get provider and uniqid from auth
  find account, user
  move all funds from user to signed in user
  change all accounts with user_id to signed in user id

Create tip:
  Look for account with scraped provider and uniqid. If none found make one.
  Use above for tippee_id.
  tipper_id of first account from current user that matches provider (can offer choice later)
  state created
  insert tip
  return uuid to use in url

Resolve tip:
  we have:
    current user_id
    tip info:
      tipper_id
      tippee_id

  get tipper_id and tippee_id accounts, check if they have user_id of current user

  check if user id matches either tippee or tipper account- error if not
  set state based on this- resolve or claim
  move amount from escrow to user




Merging users:

User already has account with other provider(s). They receive a tip on a new provider, and are not
signed in to that provider. They claim the tip using the new user resolve flow. A new account is created.

Option 1:

Do you already have a dogewand account? Click here to merge accounts.
Need both users. NOTE: profile info is effectively same as user object.
Use passport authorize, then use profile info to look up additional account.
When you have the additional account, choose which direction to merge in.

Get balance of merge account. Move all funds from merge account to the other account.
Add auth info from merge account into other account. Delete merge account.


Want to move *to* otheraccount:
When one has accepted a tip on a new provider, creating superflous account, which one is logged into
at the time.

Want to move *from* otheraccount:
When one would like to start tipping on a new provider and is logged into the account one would like
to tip with.


Is there anything bad that happens if one merges a whole array of providers and not just one?

- Not that I can think of right now


Option 2:




Iframe comms flow:

option 1

* Loader opens iframe
* Saves reference to iframe
* Sends version to iframe
* iframe checks version, maybe pops update modal

option 2

* Loader opens Iframe
* Iframe sends hello message
* Loader saves reference to iframe
* Sends version to iframe
* iframe checks version, maybe pops update modal

TODO:

* API tests
* Automatically update balances from deposits
* Deal with remaining login jank
*


Putting whole thing in iframe-

  * Load zepto twice- fuck it (maybe use native dom stuff??)
  * Channel.js framework if needed? probably not right now
  * Just seperate the shit out, put dom scraping stuff outside.

  * Seperate lib file in iframe- like normal website
  * Still concatting everything outside

  Outside script functionality:
    * Load and resize iframe
    * Page scraping functionality
    * Talk to stuff inside
    * Does it need to even do any ajax???
    * Be as small as possible

  Iframe script functionality:
    * Send resize messages
    * Pop modals
    * Display forms
    * Send ajax or possibly just form submits?
    * MVP for toolbar, balance. later, tips lists

  Preprocessing needed:

    Outside script:
      * Concat lib stuff
      * Minify
      * Incremental not needed? (unless there is html or smthing?)

    Iframe script:
      * Same stuff from before- incremental etc.
      * Put css straight in page, process seperately

How to show tip confirmation

1. Send close postmessage on submit

  Pros
    * Simplest

  Cons
    * Will need to reload tips in extension, likely race condition


2. Send post with js in iframe, send closer postmessage with data to extension

  Pros
    * Most elegant

  Cons
    * Need to write xmlhhtp requests or load zepto or other lib redundantly


3. Redirect to iframe closer page, load tip confirmation in extension upon close

  Pros
    * Simple
    * Eliminates race condition by controlling timing

  Cons
    * Need to make another request


4. Submit form normally, redirect to closer page with templated-in data.

  Pros
    * Simple to build

  Cons
    * Weird


5. Submit form normally, reload page with flash message with tip data for extension.

  Pros
    * Existing solutions
    * Flash messages will be good to have for other stuff?

  Cons
    * Old school?
    * Reload flicker
    * Need to learn new module
